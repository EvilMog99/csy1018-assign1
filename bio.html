        <p class="text-class"><!--Description of self below - contains list of skills and pass times (not full skills list)-->
          I am currently studying at the University of Northampton in the first year of Computer Games Development. In my spare time I like to write programs
          in a variety of programming languages including Java, Action Script, but most of all C#. The main and favourite focus of my programming is computer games,
          from Tower Defence to Factory games.
        </p>

        <p class="text-class"><!--New paragraph to hold personal details like sports and volunteering-->
          I also like to try and keep fit by taking part in once a week Badminton sessions, as well as cycling (both out doors and on a machine) and I also try and get
          outside for hour long walks on days when I have time to. Other activities which I do outside of University include volunteering at the British Heart Foundation.
          During the holidays I help out for at least two mornings a week.
        </p>

        <p class="text-class"><!--Final line to show aspirations-->
          I aspire to become a professional computer games programmer who either works in a small company or for a much larger corporation.
