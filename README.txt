    What was implemented correctly:
The features which where successfully implemented where the articles including types 1, 2 and 3
which were each used on different pages to show make it easier for the user to distinguish each page from the other.
Although each article and div ("div-content") where left with similar values for their margins and padding as this would give each one the same 3D
effect when being viewed. This was done to conform to the Google Material Design's rule about allow items on the screen having the same thickness, so
as to make the page look neater.

Another feature which was implemented successfully was the pofile picture in the index page, which is contained inside a div within an article. Part of
this implementation included the changing of the image's height and width as well as the div and article's so that the bouarder of roughly 1em could be
maintained all around it.


    What was implemented incorrectly:
Although article and div-content types 1, 2 and 3 were implemented succefilly to give a 3D effect the other feature on the pages such as header, head and footer
did not have this effect added. One of the reasons for this is that the shadowing effect made by the article under the div-content would make the page look unbalanced
as it would have put a distance of 1em betweent he side of the footer's/header's/head's content and the left hand side of the screen. For this reason I chose only to use
the effect for large blocks of content held within the page.

One of the features which wasn't implemented so well was the resetting of the articles in terms of its display on other browsers. This is because although the website functions in the
same way in Chrome and Firefox (to reset the articles to fit on the thinner screen), its media queries don't activate in the same way in Safari on Iphone devices, even if the "min-width"
used to activate it is wider than the page is itself. However most aspects of the site are still visible and
