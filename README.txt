Assignment 1 Write up


What was implemented correctly:
The features which were successfully implemented where the articles including types 1, 2, 3 and 4
which were each used on different pages to make it easier for the user to distinguish each page from the other, and allow unique media queries for them on each page.
Although each article and div ("div-content") where left with similar values for their margins and padding as this would give each one the same 3D
effect when being viewed. This was done to conform to the Google Material Design's rule about items on the screen having the same thickness, so
as to make the page look neater.

Another feature which was implemented successfully was the profile picture in the index page, which is contained inside a div within an article. Part of
this implementation included the changing of the image's height and width as well as the div and article's so that the boarder of roughly 1em could be
maintained all around it. In addition this image was successfully optimised to 10.3KB which will make it faster to load and easier to store.

The links used to navigate around the site have all been successfully implemented and are operational on both PC and mobile devices. Furthermore, the use
of icons in the Nav bar has also been successful, and it is now possible to get to any page on the site from any other page (on the site). In addition to this, links to the
index and contact page have been implemented in the footer for different pages to help any users who are unsure about what the icons mean.

Another feature which has been successfully implemented is the animation for changing the colour around the icon link for the current page. This was done
to help users to see which page they are currently on and where they are in the site. Furthermore this animation uses colours which are similar to the rest
of the page and runs the animation slowly so that the user is not constantly being distracted from the page's main content, but will see it when they look at the Nav bar.
As these colours are like other colours which can be found on the page it keeps the design simple.


Both the HTML and CSS code has passed the W3C.org tests for errors and the icon to show that the CSS passed at a high standard can be seen in commit 31 on GitHub.


  What was implemented incorrectly:
Although article and div-content types 1, 2, 3 and 4 were implemented successfully to give a 3D effect the other features on the pages such as header, head, nav and footer
don't have this effect added. One of the reasons for this is that the shadowing effect made by the article under the div-content would make the page look unbalanced
as it would have put a distance of 1em between the left side of the footer's/header's/head's/nav's content and the left-hand side of the screen, making the content look unbalanced.
For this reason it was decided that the effect would only be used for large blocks of content held within the page. In addition this feature also helps to draw the user to look at the
articles' content more than the rest of the page.

One of the features which wasn't implemented so well was the resetting of the articles in terms of its display on other browsers. This is because although the website functions in the
same way in Chrome and Firefox (to reset the articles to fit on the thinner screen), its media queries don't activate in the same way in Safari on Iphone devices.


  Design:
The visual design of this website was based on the ideas given by Google on material design [1] and the lay out was influenced by the joel.sh site [2]. The arrangement of the images for
the material design #introduction-goals page and three image/links in joel.sh's home page inspired the use of three articles side by side in the CV page. Another feature derived from
material design was the use of animations to give the user feedback. Animations have been used to draw attention to the icon used to access that page, which shows which page the user is on.
This feature allows the selected icon to stay on screen (making naviagation easier) without taking up unnessessary space. All the pages are designed to show the minimum content in the
centre of the screen, to make it easier to focus on it.  Furthermore, the colours blue and cyan were used to keep a simplicsic colour balance like the ones shown in the material design
and material palette. These colours are used to highlight certain aspects of the site, like the cyan which shows all headers and naviagation objects. Blue is used in articles of
information and the background for the navigation and footer. Blue was chosen for the main features because it creates a relaxed atmosphere for the viewer. Black was used in the background
to help the blue to be seen and to not overwhelm the viewer with bright colours, such as white. However other colours were used for minor purposes, like the two colours that highlight the
selected icon in the navigation bar. A darker blue was used to make it stand out next to the blue background. Light purple was used to keep the colour similar to the other icons' boarders,
but let it stand out. A darker blue is also used as the shadow for the articles to create an illusion of density and make them look more realistic, which will draw the user to look at their
content.
