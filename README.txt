    What was implemented correctly:

The features which where successfully implemented where the articles including types 1, 2 and 3
which were each used on different pages to make it easier for the user to distinguish each page from the others. In addition, articles where chosen
to lay out and set the shadow for the article-div-content to make it easier to distinguish and place the individual sections of the site.
The content in each page is displayed in various types of div ("article-div-content" classes) which are displayed at an offset in articles with a colour
to match. This is layed out by using padding of 1em in each article to offset the div inside on both the X and Y axis. Although, each article and
div ("article-div-content") were left with similar values for their margins and padding as this would give each one the same 3D
effect when being viewed. This was done to conform to the Google Material Design's rule about items on the screen having the same thickness effect, so
as to make the page look neater.

Another feature which was implemented successfully was the pofile picture in the index page, which is contained inside a div within an article. Part of
this implementation included the changing of the image's height and width as well as the div and article's so that the bouarder of roughly 1em could be
maintained all around it.

The links used to navigate around the site have all been successfully implemented and are operational on both PC and mobile devices. Furthermore the use
of icons in the Nav bar has also been successful, and it is now possible to get to any page on the site from any page. In addition to this links to the
index and contact page have been implemented in the footer for different pages to help any users who are unsure about what theicons mean.

Another feature which has been successfully implemented is the animation for changing the colour around the icon link for the current page. This was done
to help users  to see which page they are currently on and where they are in the site. Furthermore this animation consists of a light purple highligh which
becomes blue slowly and then fades back to light purple again which keeps the number of different colours on the page down, as the light purple and blue are
very similar to other colours which can be found on the page. In addition, the animation runs slowly enough that it won't unnesessarily draw the user's
attention, but the colours are different enough that the animation can be easily recognised when the user looks at the Nav bar.

The Nav bar was implemented to hold four linked icon images which the user can use to navigate around the website. This was done by setting "space-between" for justify-content
so that each icon would have equal space between them, which makes this site more compatible with mobile devices and other screens of different sizes. The location of this bar
is set to the very top of the page using order: -1, so that it is always in the same location and is easy to find. Another feature of this is the . In addition
a light blue background was used with 1em of padding to surround the icons. This was done because it makes it obvious to the viewer that the icons are all part of one bar and
because the light blue doesn't differ too much from the main colour scheme used on the rest of the site.

    What was implemented incorrectly:

Although article and div-content types 1, 2 and 3 were implemented succefilly to give a 3D effect the other feature on the pages such as header, head and footer
did not have this effect added. One of the reasons for this is that the shadowing effect made by the article under the div-content would make the page look unbalanced
as it would have put a distance of 1em betweent he side of the footer's/header's/head's content and the left hand side of the screen. For this reason I chose only to use
the effect for large blocks of content held within the page.

One of the features which wasn't implemented so well was the resetting of the articles in terms of its display on other browsers. This is because although the website functions in the
same way in Chrome and Firefox (to reset the articles to fit on the thinner screen), its media queries don't activate in the same way in Safari on Iphone devices.
