What was implemented correctly:
The features which were successfully implemented where the articles including types 1, 2 and 3
which were each used on different pages to show make it easier for the user to distinguish each page from the other.
Although each article and div ("div-content") where left with similar values for their margins and padding as this would give each one the same 3D
effect when being viewed. This was done to conform to the Google Material Design's rule about allow items on the screen having the same thickness, so
as to make the page look neater.

Another feature which was implemented successfully was the profile picture in the index page, which is contained inside a div within an article. Part of
this implementation included the changing of the image's height and width as well as the div and article's so that the boarder of roughly 1em could be
maintained all around it.

The links used to navigate around the site have all been successfully implemented and are operational on both PC and mobile devices. Furthermore, the use
of icons in the Nav bar has also been successful, and it is now possible to get to any page on the site from any page. In addition to this links to the
index and contact page have been implemented in the footer for different pages to help any users who are unsure about what the icons mean.

Another feature which has been successfully implemented is the animation for changing the colour around the icon link for the current page. This was done
to help users  to see which page they are currently on and where they are in the site. Furthermore this animation consists of a light purple highlight which
becomes blue slowly and then fades back to light purple again which keeps the number of different colours on the page down, as the light purple and blue are
very similar to other colours which can be found on the page. In addition, the animation runs slowly enough that it won't unnecessarily draw the user's
attention, but the colours are different enough that the animation can be easily recognised when the user looks at the Nav bar.



Both the HTML and CSS code has passed the W3C.org tests for errors and the icon to show that the CSS passed at a high standard can be seen in commit 31 on GitHub.


  What was implemented incorrectly:
Although article and div-content types 1, 2, 3 and 4 were implemented successfully to give a 3D effect the other feature on the pages such as header, head, nav and footer
did not have this effect added. One of the reasons for this is that the shadowing effect made by the article under the div-content would make the page look unbalanced
as it would have put a distance of 1em between the left side of the footer's/header's/head's/nav's content and the left-hand side of the screen, making the content look unbalanced.
For this reason it was decided that the effect would only be used for large blocks of content held within the page. In addition this feature also helps to draw the user to look at the
articles' content more than the rest of the page.

One of the features which wasn't implemented so well was the resetting of the articles in terms of its display on other browsers. This is because although the website functions in the
same way in Chrome and Firefox (to reset the articles to fit on the thinner screen), its media queries don't activate in the same way in Safari on Iphone devices.


Design:
The visual design of this website was based on the ideas given by Google on material design at the address https://material.io/guidelines/#introduction-principles and the lay out of
the joel.sh web site at the address https://joel.sh/. The arrangement of the images for the material design #introduction-goals page and three image/links in joel.sh's home page inspired
the use of three articles side by side in the CV page. Another feature which was derived from Google's material design was the use of animations to give the user feedback.
Although there isn't any animated motion included in this website, animations have been used to highlight and draw attention to the icon used to go to the current page which allows the
user to see which page they are currently on. In addition this feature allows for this icon to be kept on the screen (making the naviagation easier to understand) without taking up space for no reason.
Furthermore this animation uses colours which are similar to the rest of the page and runs the animation slowly so that the user is not constantly being distracted from the page's main content.
The majority of the pages in this site are designed to only show the minimum amount of content in the centre of the screen, as this makes it easier for th user to focus on the content in the site.
In addition to this the use of the colours blue, light blue and black were used to keep a simplicsic colour balance like the ones show in the Google material design. The normal and light blues are used to highlight
certain aspects of the site such as the ligth blue which shows all header and naviagation objects. The normal blue is used to show articles of information as well as the background for the naviagatin and footer.
The colour blue was chosen originally for the main features of this site because it creates a relaxed atmosphere for the viewer. The colour black was used in the background to help the blue to be more easily seen and to
not overwhelm the user with bright colours, which would have been the effect if white had been used. However other colours have also been used for minor purposes, such as the two colour that the highlight the selected icon
in the navigation bar. The darker blue in this was used so that it would stand out next to its blue background. The light purple in the was used to keep the colour similar to the boarder of the other icons, but still let this
one stand out. Furthermore a darker blue is used as the shadow for the articles in which a div holding the content is situated. This is done to create an illusion of density and make the articles look more realistic, which will
draw the user to look at their content.
